# TicTacToe

This is a two-player version of the standard Tic Tac Toe game. 

# How to play
Win the game by being the first person to get three in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Each player takes turns.


# Features implemented
* Rendered a game board in the browser
* Switch turns between players as represented by avatars.
* Declares a winner when a player gets three in a row or a tie game if all the pieces are played without a winner. It also specifies how the winner won (*e.g.* "Player 1 horizontally.")
* Allows two players to compete on separate devices
* The game logic also prevents a player from selecting a cell that already been chosen. 
* The game logic prevents additional actions when there is a winner. 
* When there is a winner, either player can choose to play additional games and keep adding to the score, or can start fresh with a zero to zero score.
 
# Planned improvements
Rotating tic tac toe screen. More challenging versions of the game with a scoring system that factors in difficulty levels (*e.g.* difficulty level 2 would give double points.) That can be combined with betting via a window adjacent to the texting window.

Carousel functionality [The carousel functionality is built by Julien Bouquillon (https://github.com/revolunet/angular-carousel) and was released under the permissive MIT license.]
